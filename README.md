This repository demonstrates a common error in assembly programming: accessing an array element outside its bounds. The `bug.asm` file contains the erroneous code, while `bugSolution.asm` shows the corrected version.  The error arises from a lack of bounds checking on the array index, which can lead to crashes or unpredictable results. The solution adds a check to ensure the index is within the valid range of the array.
